Introduction
The message queuing system is implemented using the various Amazon web services such as Lambda function, API Gateway, SQS- Queue Service.
These services put together help implement our api for queuing or stacking the messages on the cloud. 
The API Gateway is used to deploy the functions onto an endpoint for universal access. 
The SQS helps in queuing the messages in the cloud that can retrieved online. 

Steps of Implementation

 Step 1: Creating the Lambda functions to perform enqueuing on the message queue. 
 Step 2: Creating a message queue on the SQS
 Step 3: Creating an api to deploy the lambda functions created
 Step 4: Defining the get, post methods of the api in order to define the data that shall be enqueued and the data that shall be displayed on the screen after enqueuing.
 Step 5: Deploying the api
 Step 6: Viewing the endpoint
